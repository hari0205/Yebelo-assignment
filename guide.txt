This is a smart contract to find the slab assigned.

To test it manually without hardhat/Chai:
- Copy paste Yebelo.sol into remix IDE.
- Compile and Deploy the contract
- Copy the address of the smart contract 
- In the "transferToContract" function , pasted the address of the smart contract and the amount of tokens you'd like to transfer. Execute the function
- After a successful transfer, copy the address of the wallet used to deploy the contract (mostly the address1)
- Paste the address of the wallet copied in the previous step and run the function.
- After a successful transfer, you can see the slab assigned.\

To test with Chai:
- Clone the repository. 
- Open with your code editior.
- Open terminal with your code editior.
- Run npm install *
- Run npx hadhat compile
- Run npx hardhat test


Features:
- Mapped address to a struct so that it can be useful for displaying additional information at any time. Useful when extending 
- Safety checks to ensure you don't query without sending tokens to contract address
- Can transfer tokens between wallets on non smart contracts too.
- Can check the slab of any address


* Sometimes on some machines, you can run into dependancy issues. Delete the files , reclone the the repo and install hardhat waffle ethers separately to avoid errors. refer https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70628980/typeerror-cannot-read-properties-of-undefined-reading-getcontractfactory-wh
